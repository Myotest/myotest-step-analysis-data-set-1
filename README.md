Pre-recorded 3 axes accelerometer signal data set, mix of walk and run, sensor worn on the belt

The sensor used was a KXTJ9 Accelerometer, placed on the belt. The sample acquisition frequency was 100Hz throughout the test. The test was also videoed for visual step recount.

Data set recorded entirely outdoor with a healthy male subject. The subject walked and ran in a straight line on tarmac at self-selected paces. Firstly, he walked 24 steps then run 24 steps and used a final 2 walking step when slowing down to a stop, at the end.

Visual recount by two independent judges confirmed 26 walking steps and 24 running steps

3844 samples of timestamp and 3 axes accelerometer signal are recorded in this data set
